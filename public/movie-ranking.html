<h2>Here are my top 3 movies. Movies are set in no paticular order.</h2>

<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I absolutely loved the book. I read it back in 5th grade. The movie was created so beatifully and the visuals are truly art. There were quite a few changes between the movie and the book, but I didn't mind them.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Dealthy Hallows: Part 2</h3>
<p>As a kid, I followed along with the books as they came out. I started reading the series since the 2nd book had been released. Seeing my favorite childhood book finally conclude in a movie was bittersweet. I have rewatched it many times and see myself wathcing it many more</p>

<h3>What a Girl Wants</h3>
<p>I loved watching "chick flicks" at various points in my life. This is one I find myself coming back to again and again and still enjoy it. Is the movie cringey at times? Yes. Is it somewhat outdated? Also, yes. But, it's just a fun, feel good movie and I won't apologize for it.</p>
